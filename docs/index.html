  Ex-astrophysicist turned large-scale computing.

- Large-scale high-speed adaptive reactive fluid fluids

- DOE ASCI Center at Chicago
    - ASCI Red
    - ASCI Blue
    - ASCI White

- FORTRAN, MPI, Oct-tree regular adaptive mesh

- Joined HPC centre after postdoc

- Worked with researchers on wide variety of problems
]

???
Before we start, let me tell you a little about where I'm coming
from.  This story is probably pretty familiar to many of you - I
started off doing science with computing, and ended up drifting to
the other side of that divide, doing computing to support science.

I was doing pretty pretty standard HPC stuff - high speed reactive
flows (explicit methods), adaptive grid, FORTRAN with some C and
python, that sort of thing.

After doing a postdoc in Toronto, I moved into the HPC Centre
there, working with them and Compute Canada - a little like 
PRACE or XSEDE - and working with a lot of different researchers
doing a lot of different problems.

Started my career (c1995-2005) when large scale scientific computing was:

* ~20 years of stability
* Bunch of x86, MPI, ethernet or infiniband
* No one outside of academia was much doing big number/data crunching
* Pretty stable set of problems

Now found myself thrust into the most exciting time in scientific computing
maybe ever.

Started looking into Genomics in ~2013:
 - Large computing needs
 - Very interesting algorithmic challenges
 - HPCer to the rescue, right?

Made move in 2014

- Ontario Institute for Cancer Research

- Working with Jared Simpson, author of ABySS (amongst other things)
    - First open-source human-scale de novo genome assembler
    - MPI-based 
]
???
Before too long, I started
becoming interested in genomics - partly because it was the new
frontier, with fascinating and deep algorithmic challenges, but
also required very large-scale computing to accomplish its promise.

I began working in genomics with Jared Simpson, who amongst other
accomplishments was the author of ABySS, one of the very early
large-scale de novo genome assemblers from what we now call short
reads.  It tackled large --- including human --- genomes by using
distributed memory, using MPI.  So it sounds like I found a pretty
good niche in Genomics for an HPCer, right?

Not quite.

ABySS 2.0 just came out, with a new non-MPI mode which will almost
certainly become the default after the kinks are worked out.  There
are absolutely no plans by any of the development team to develop
new MPI-based algorithms or tools

It's very difficult to describe what place Chapel does and can occupy in the
landscape without drawing a map, so what I want to do for the beginning
of our time together is to walk through these new territories with you.

I want to talk about some common big data analysis tasks and point
out how similar they are to familiar simulation tasks.  Then I'd
like to show some of the programming models that are springing up 
are tackling these problems.

Once we've sketched out the map, I want to describe the place I see
Chapel as occupying now &mdash; and the attractive neighbouring vacant
territories that it can occupy if it wants.

It was a simpler time:
* Statistial Computing largely the domain of the social sciences, some experimental sciences
    - R was beginning to be quite popular

* Physical scientists working with Big Iron or workstations, performing simulation or analysis of comparitively regular data sets
    - FORTRAN/C/C++(?) + MPI + OpenMP
    - FORTRAN/C/C++(?)
    - MATLAB, IDL
    - Python (Numeric)

* Not a lot of SQL/database work in traditional technical computing, but communications up and downstream w/ statistical computing

* Maybe infrequent ferry service between statistical computing and MATLAB communities

## And Then They Came, c. 2007

Widespread adption of computing and networking brought *data*, and lot of it.
* "Internet-scale" companies were the first businesses to try taking advantage of all their data, but others soon followed
    - Hadoop, HDFS spawned an entire ecosystem

* In the sciences, genomics was in the right place at right time
    - Success of Human Genome Project in 2003 
    - High-throughput sequencing technologies becoming available
    - Lots and lots of data - but how to process it?

<img src="assets/img/ScientificComputing2017.png" width=33% style="float: right;"></img>

* The newcomers started with some of their own tools (Hadoop, HDFS)

* (Some of) the data-analysis handling communities jumped at the chance to start working with the data-intensive newcomers
    - Similar needs, interests
    - Python on the general computing and physical sciences side
    - R on the statistics/Machine Learning (neé data mining) side

* The simulation science communities, which makes up most of traditional HPC, were more skeptical
    - Needs seemed very different
    - Very different terminology
    - Initial tools (Hadoop Map-Reduce) were all out of core, calculations very simple (analytics)
    - Still not a lot of overlap

Will argue that they are not so different, and there's a lot to learn (on both sides) across the data science/simulation science divide

* Simulations are getting more complex, dynamic

* Big data problems have long been in-memory, increasingly compute intensive

* Moving towards each other in fits and starts

I tend to place Chapel as a redoubt on the outskirts of traditional HPC terrain, trying to lead the community towards where the action is:
  - Productive tooling

  - Modern language affordances

  - Making it easier to tackle scale, more complex problems

Big Data problems same as HPC, if in different context

- Large scale network problems
    - Graph operations
- Similarity computations, clustering, optimization, 
    - Linear algebra
    - Tree methods

    - FFTs, smoothing, ...

Main difference: hit highly irregular, unstructured, dyanamic problems
earlier in data analysis than simulation (but Exascale...)

- Irregular data lookups:
    - Key-Value Stores

???
Ultimately Big Data problems are more or less the same problems we
face in HPC although in a different context.

The Big Data crowd hit problems of dealing with wildly irregular,
unstructured, dynamic data structures first - irregularity to a
degree that we've up til now been able to avoid in simulation...
but may not be able to on the road to Exascale.

In simulation, you normally have the luxury of knowing exactly where
needed data is, because you put it there.

.right-column[
With faults, or rapid dynamism, or too-large scale to keep all state
nearby, less true.

Data analysis: much of genomics involves lookups in indices too large
for one node's memory

- Good/simple/robust distributed hash tables within an application
would be extremely valuable.

Begins to look a lot like distributed key-value stores in big data.

Highly irregular access (don't know where you're sending to, receiving
from, when requests are coming, or how many messages you will receive/send) has
not been the strong suit of MPI-based HPC stacks.

???
The users and developers of in-memory NoSQL databases view performance
as crucial, and so teams are enormously concerned with latency -
especially since a query (and especially an update) may involve
several messages between participating nodes.  The discussions
surrounding latency, bandwidth, cache utilisation, threading, etc would 
all be extremely familiar to those who work on HPC software.

Almost any sort of numeric computation requires linear algebra.

In many big-data applications, the linear algebra is _extremely_ sparse and unstructured;
say doing similarity calculations of documents, using a bag-of-words model.

If looking at ngrams, cardinality can be enormous, no real pattern to sparsity

Almost any sort of numeric computation requires linear algebra.
That's just mathematics, and is inescapable.

In many big-data applications, the linear algebra is _extremely_
sparse and unstructured; say doing similarity calculations of
documents, using a bag-of-words model, where order is ignored
and documents are described as simply occurrance counts words ---
very sparse integer vectors.

Words are one thing, but If looking at ngrams, 
cardinality can be enormous, no real pattern to sparsity

As with other problems - big data graphs are like HPC graphs, but more so.

As with other problems - big data graphs are like HPC graphs, but more so.

For graphs in physical science simulation - say unstructured grids -
or analysis, nodes typically have say within a factor of two or order of
magnitude the same number of neighbours.

Not so with (say) social media graphs:
Very sparse, very irregular: nodes can have enormously varying degrees

Looking over Spark, it's easy to see some Pros and Cons (from the point of view of _our_ use cases; 
Spark has been designed and optimized for its community, and Big Data users would have a different list of Pros/Cons)

A big one from our point of view is that the relatively heavyweight infrastructure around individual Spark processes
means that it scales *down* fairly poorly.

But the point here isn't that I'm proposing that our simulation
codes should be rewritten in Spark - that would be silly.  

The point is that other communities are building high-productivity tools for
doing number-crunching for a user community that cares a great deal
about performance and scale - not least of which because they pay real money
for cycles - and they're not building it on top of MPI.

Single-core performance is very good, particularly for a JIT.

Test below is for a simple 1-d stencil calculation ( https://www.dursi.ca/post/julia-vs-chapel.html )

<table>
<th>time</th> <th>Julia</th> <th>Chapel</th> <th>Numpy + Numba</th><th>Numpy</th>
</thead>
<tbody style="border: 1px solid black;">
<tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">run</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">0.0084</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">0.0098 s</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">0.017 s</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">0.069 s</td></tr>
<tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">compile</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">0.57 s</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">4.8s</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">0.73 s</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;"> - </td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Julia edges out Chapel... but for this test, look at Python with Numpy and numba, only a factor of two behind.

Single-core performance has been the main focus of Julia, to the exclusion of almost all else - multithreading is still considered experimental.

### Distributed Data
]
.right-column[
Julia has a DistributedArray module, but it has very large overhead; better suited for merging data once at the end of long purely local computation (processing and then stacking images, etc)

Below is a test for running on 8 cores of a (single) node:

 <table style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; border-collapse:collapse;">
 <tbody style="border: 1px solid black;">
 <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black;" colspan=2>Julia </td><td style="border: 1px solid black;" colspan=2>Chapel</td><td>Dask</td> </tr>
 <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;"> -p=1</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">-p=8</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">-nl=1 tasks=8</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">-nl=8 tasks=1</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">workers=8</td></tr>
 <td style="border: 1px solid black;">177s s</td>
 <td style="border: 1px solid black;">264 s</td>
 <td style="border: 1px solid black;">**0.4 s**</td>
 <td style="border: 1px solid black;">145 s</td>
 <td style="border: 1px solid black;">193 s</td></tr>
 </tbody>
 </table>

Need to be able to easily exploit threading, NUMA locality, cross-node communications...

Julia has good libraries for data analysis, modest support for graph algorithms, but all single-node; very little support for distributed memory computing.

### Pros/Cons
]
.right-column[
**Cons**
* Very little performant support for distributed memory computing, not clear it is forthcoming

**Pros**

* Single core fast, and on-node fairly fast
* Very nice interactive use, works with Jupyter or REPL
* Some excellent libraries
* Very powerful platform for writing DSLs
